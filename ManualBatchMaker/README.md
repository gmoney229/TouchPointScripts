# Manual Batch Maker

## Description

I need to make the same set of batches each week for manual data entry.

- Given a json make the set of batches
    - Load the json and display
    - make date variable
- choose a batch that you want to clone
- default by hand (Stretch goal)


### Python script

Pick the json you want

Load the json and display

Stretch goal = pick a person maybe too specific idk

Eventually may use external json files. In that case copy the example json and replace as needed.
